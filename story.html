					<h3>The earlier years...</h3>
					<p class="nowrap">
						Kristina and Nathan met when Nathan graduated from college and moved to Pittsburgh, and Kristina moved back to Pittsburgh after studying abroad in Ireland.  A fortunate stroke
						of serendipity allowed them to be next door neighbors on the notorious Jane Street in the Southside of Pittsburgh.  Kristina could not resist Nathan's persistence of pursuit and soon enough, she
						gave in to his wit and charm.  He likes to think his impeccable dance moves played a pivotal role.
					</p>
					<p class="nowrap">
						Kristina continuously wowed Nathan with her boisterous personality and wizardly skills in the kitchen and it felt like every other day, she would require his nerdy-skills to fix
						her computer.  Some have wondered if Nathan deliberately broke her computer, so he could spend more time with her.  After a few months of periodical rendezvous, they realized they
						had something special.

					<h3>In the meantime...</h3>
					<p class="nowrap">
						Nathan and Kristina have settled into Philadelphia after a big move across the state from Pittsburgh, in June of 2010.  They have been enjoying the local cuisine 
						and the many charming bring-your-own restaurants spattered throughout the city.  Nathan has been traveling each week for work, so unfortunately he does not get to 
						experience as much of what the city has to offer as he would like to.  Kristina has been busy as well, working as a Pharmacist for Rite Aid in many different stores, 
						mostly in the Southern New Jersey area.  They have still been enjoying their favorite hobby, traveling, and their latest getaway was to Puerto Rico for a quick New Year's vacation. 
						When Nathan is home, mainly on the weekends, he looks forward to either a nice night out on the town to one of the many local restaurants or conversely, a quiet night in, with 
						Chef Kristina taking over the kitchen with a new surprise recipe.

					<h3>The proposal...</h3>
					<p class="nowrap">
						Leading up to the 2009 Holiday Season, Nathan convinced Kristina they should take a vacation, somewhere nice and warm to get out of the dreadful Pittsburgh winter weather.  After a few
						weeks of monotonous research, they settled on a cruise vacation into Central America, visiting Belize, Honduras, and Mexico.  Little did Kristina know that behind the scenes Nathan
						was scheming together a plot that would change the rest of her life.  On the second night of the cruise, December 14th, 2009, Nathan kept hassling Kristina to hurry up and get ready
						(which, should be noted is not an anomaly) so they could get some pictures taken at sunset.  They found a quiet, empty table towards the back of the ship and sat down to enjoy the views over
						a nice bottle of wine.  At an opportune time, Nathan mentioned to Kristina that he had brought her on the cruise for a reason, which she immediately replied with a substantial
						smile, "No you didn't!?".  Of course she anticpated the next few words out of Nathan's mouth when he finally asked the question.  Kristina was completely taken aback and shocked, but 
						completely thrilled.  She immediately proclaimed, "Yes!".
