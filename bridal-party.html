						<h3>Casey Kramer - Maid of Honor</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Kristina met Casey Kramer in her freshman year at Duquesne University.  The two girls were lucky enough to be on the same floor in their freshman dorm.  
							You often hear that the people you meet during your first year in college will remain your close friends for life, and Kristina is lucky to have met a few!  
							Since then, Casey and Kristina have enjoyed studying abroad, living together in the Southside of Pittsburgh, and many other fun activities!

						<h3>Katlin Connelly</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Kristina met Katlin in her freshman year at Duquesne University as well.  As she started spending more and more time with Katlin throughout her first two years in 
							college, Kristina knew they had a special friendship.  They had a lot in common, which led them to become roommates for two years, study abroad and travel together, and much more!

						<h3>Angela Bucci</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Angela and Kristina met at Duquesne, as they were in the same pharmacy class for six years.  Even though they did not discover their friendship until third year, but 
							Kristina considers herself lucky to have had such a great friend and study partner by her side through the years.  Kristina and Angela spent most of their time in the library, 
							but when they needed to unwind they enjoyed heading to the Southside and sharing a “fish bowl”.  Now that they have both graduated and are practicing as Pharmacists, they are 
							enjoying an easy friendship swapping funny stories.

						<h3>Dana Kessler</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Kristina had gone to school with Dana her whole life, although they only began their friendship on the bus freshman year in high school. Luckily, it was early on in 
							high school, because their friendship grew quickly from there and they had a great time together throughout high school.  They had a lot of fun times going to
							concerts, the beach, Sundaes (local ice cream shop) and of course their favorite destination, Kristina's basement.   Even though Kristina traveled far to go to
							college, Dana was no stranger and they have kept in touch to this day!

						<h3>Katie Jones</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Katie Jones is one of Kristina's oldest friends.  Their friendship began back in 2nd grade when Katie and her family moved across the 
							street.  They were the best of friends, playing with the neighborhood kids, having sleepovers, and playing in their creation “Katie's Cafe”.  
							Throughout the years, Katie has moved around the country many times, but Katie and Kristina never ended their friendship, as they were great pen pals.  
							Luckily, Katie kept coming back, having moved to three different homes in Voorhees, N.J., always within a block of Kristina's home.  Although
							they don't see each other as much these days, they will always be lifelong friends.

						<h3>Rosemary Khalifa &amp; Serena Arnouk</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Rosemary and Serena are Kristina's cousins on her mother's side of the family.  Kristina, Rosemary, and Serena are the only three girl cousins in the family, 
							and us girls like to stick together!  Kristina remembers back in the day when none of them could drive, and all they ever wanted was to take a trip to 7-Eleven.  
							Times have sure changed since then, and Kristina has watched her young cousins grow up throughout the years and become beautiful and caring young college students!

						<h3>Zac Kephart - Best man</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Zac and Nathan have been great friends since they were young kids. They have a lot in common, including their love for cycling, but Zac 
							takes his passion a step further... he shaves his legs more than most women.  When Nathan and Zac reminisce about their previous  incarnations, 
							they sometimes wonder how they made it out in one piece.  Today, they are still close friends, and when they get together you 
							can be sure there will be some good laughs, with all of their bantering.

						<img src="images/bridal-party/img_4094.jpg" title="Adam Mathias" alt="Adam" class="left" style="padding-right: 25px;" />
						<h3>Adam Mathias</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							 Adam and Nathan like to say they have known each other since they were in the womb, as they were born only one day apart and slapped hands 
							 the hospital.  Since then, they always knew they would be lifelong friends.  They grew up together in the same neighborhood and got into 
							 their fair share of mischief, especially during their games of “night tag”, gallivanting through neighbors' yards.  They remain close friends today 
							 and Nathan likes to think of Adam as his number one supplier for homemade deer jerky and sauerkraut.

						<img src="images/bridal-party/img_1190.jpg" title="Steve Slu" alt="Slu" class="right" style="padding-left: 25px;" />
						<h3>Rev Dom Steve Slusarski</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Nathan and Steve have been great friends ever since they lived together for a few years after their college years.  They've spent many nights frolicking around the Southside of
							Pittsburgh, biking through the streets of Pittsburgh, swimming with piranhas in the Amazon River, and hiking the Inca Trail.  Steve is quite a trailblazer, especially while trying
							to find extraordinary places to rest.  Don't be surprised if you find him sleeping in the Liberty Bell during the wedding weekend.

						<h3>Willie Keith</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Willie and Nathan met in Pittsburgh and instantly became great friends.  They were roommates for a while and share a lot of the same
							interests.  Many people may not know this, but Willie is an excellent swimmer.  While most people prefer conventional modes of transportation like cars, bikes, 
							and walking, Willie has been known to utilize his aquatic abilities and swim the rivers of Pittsburgh for transit.  Willie and Nathan both travel a good amount for work 
							and pleasure, but have managed to stay good friends.

						<img src="images/bridal-party/img_5330.jpg" title="Dave Gambone" alt="Dave" class="right" style="padding-left: 25px;" />
						<h3>Dave Gambone</h3>
						<p class="nowrap">
							Dave is Kristina's brother and only sibling.  Nathan and Dave both enjoy traveling and food, especially the scrumptious Italian and
							Lebanese cuisines.  Nathan claims he could beat Dave in a cheese steak eating competition, but the verdict is still out on that one! Somehow, 
							Nate has forgiven Dave for being a Flyers' fan and they have become good friends.
